<title>Beginning</title>
<body style="background-color:black;">

<h3 style="color:white;">Germinating neath the sphere of consciousness,<br>
Were the watery organs of the stars. Daughter of the prima materia.<br>
Floating in a thicket of energy, a path around the sun, the mother of biology.<br>
Finally dust settles into our cells, and we wake in the palm of light, while the earth <br>spins and swallows itself over and over again.<br>
On the day it slows, and the matter settles into place,<br>
Then - we wake up in the sea; the tomb of our descents.</h3>
