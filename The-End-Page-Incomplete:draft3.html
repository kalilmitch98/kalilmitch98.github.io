<body style="background-color:black;">

<h3 style="color:white;">As the vessel is sent into infinite sleep <br>
Iotas of energy ascend their cellular bodies <br> 
Passing through the eye of the atmosphere <br>
To look upon their watery womb once more <br>
Time releases its grip on the slippery will <br>
Of the cosmic pulse <br>
The pull of terrestrial energy back to its home in the stars <br>
Rich with love and memory, <br>
The current travels through waves of light <br>
Tumbling in seas of dark matter <br>
Till once again reunited with the Universal Ecology, <br>
And celebrating peace across the galaxy. </h3>
